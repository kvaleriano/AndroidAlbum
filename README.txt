# Motivation
- A neat gift for my anniversary
- Motivate myself to get experience with Kotlin

# Future work
- Access the photos through some sort of cloud storage (Google Photos?) instead of through local storage.
- Streamline the way to add comments/title/url into the DB, maybe some sort of desktop app to write down the comments and have them added into the DB. Should support emojis.
